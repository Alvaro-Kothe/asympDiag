Description: Leveraging Monte Carlo simulations, this package provides
    tools for diagnosing regression models. It implements a parametric
    bootstrap framework to compute statistics, generates diagnostic
    envelopes to assess goodness-of-fit, and evaluates type I error
    control for Wald tests. By simulating data under the assumption that
    the model is true, it helps to identify model mis-specifications and
    enhances the reliability of the model inferences.
